<h1>SailBook</h1>

<p>
SailBook is a template for single-page exchanges. The project is written in Django and uses PostgreSQL as its database. Production use of SailBook requires configuring several of its features, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Switching off "DEMO_PROJECT" in settings.py</li>
<li>Serving media files</li>
<li>Adding environment variables for hidden_settings.py</li>
</ul>
I have created a demo version of SailBook at the following URL: https://sail-book.herokuapp.com/
